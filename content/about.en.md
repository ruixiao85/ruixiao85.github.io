# Brief Biography

Rui Xiao was born in Anhui province, China, in the winter of 1985. He is the only child to a family of a kind father, a high school teacher, and a strict mother, a physician. As his father became more accomplished in his career as a teacher, the whole family moved to the city of Shanghai, soon after Rui went through middle school. A few years later, he went to Shanghai Jiao Tong University and majored in animal biotechnology. By the time for him to get the Bachelorâ€™s degree in the year 2008, one of his graduate school applications came back with a good news and he finally got in touch with Dr. Arthur Penn, who then provided him the opportunity to join the laboratory and work towards a PhD degree at Louisiana State University School of Veterinary Medicine. In the Spring of 2014, Rui Xiao completed his PhD degree and continued his postdoctoral training at Columbia University. In 2019, Rui moved to Austin for a senior scientist, bioinformatics position at Asuragen. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Rui started another Senior Scientist position at MyoKardia, now part of the Bristol Myers Squibb.
